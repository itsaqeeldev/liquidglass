# Live demo

Atlas Studio, the library's demo app, running in your browser: Compose for Web (WebAssembly) drawing
the same production shaders as Android and desktop. Tap, hold and drag the tab bar; drag the
magnifier; hold and pull the card.

## Material 3

A Material 3 app built only from `liquidglass-material3` (the screen in the [Material 3 guide](material3.md)):
the tab bar and its search button, the segmented control, buttons, chips, a switch and a slider on a
card, and from the menu a dialog and a sheet. The star button switches between the dark and light schemes.

[Open the Material 3 demo full screen](https://liquidglass.shayxo.dev/demo/#material3). It needs a browser with
WebAssembly garbage collection (current Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari 18.2 or later).

## First load

A first visit downloads about 4.5 MB (gzip), three quarters of it Skia's WebAssembly runtime, and then
compiles the glass shaders for your GPU: a few seconds on a laptop's integrated graphics, cached by the
browser afterwards. A loader shows while both happen. A browser without WebAssembly garbage collection,
a failed download or a lost graphics context is reported on the page instead of leaving it black. The
two demos above load lazily, as each approaches the viewport (`loading="lazy"`, a hint the browser
may start early).
