/**
 * A signed distance field for a shape the shader cannot describe analytically.
 *
 * The material's whole optical model runs off a distance field: depth from the rim drives the
 * refraction band, and the field's gradient is the surface normal. For rectangles, rounded
 * rectangles, capsules, circles and squircles that field has a closed form and the shader
 * evaluates it directly. For anything else — a star, a blob, a hand-drawn `GenericShape` — it
 * does not, and the honest options are to refuse the shape or to measure it.
 *
 * This measures it: rasterise the outline once, run an exact Euclidean distance transform over
 * the result, and hand the shader a texture to read instead of a formula to evaluate. It is
 * rebuilt only when the shape or the size changes, never per frame.
 *
 * Two things about the encoding are deliberate. The field is stored in eight bits over a range
 * of about one and a half refraction bands, which quantises distance to roughly a pixel — fine,
 * because the shader only ever asks two questions of it: how deep into the band a pixel is
 * (about 1% of the band) and which way the surface faces, and it answers the second by
 * differencing over a wide epsilon where a pixel of noise is nothing. The mask and distance
 * transform are computed at full resolution to preserve pad alignment, then the field is stored
 * at half resolution; bilinear sampling covers the difference.
